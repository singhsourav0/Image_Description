**Image Description**

**Purpose**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of images by generating detailed descriptions of their content. It leverages the power of image processing, computer vision, and natural language processing to bridge the gap between visual and textual domains.

**Features**

* **Image Analysis:** Extracts visual features such as objects, colors, textures, and spatial relationships from images.
* **Scene Interpretation:** Identifies the overall scene depicted in the image, including its location, activity, and time of day.
* **Object Recognition:** Recognizes and classifies objects present in the image, capturing their size, shape, and context.
* **Natural Language Description:** Generates coherent and descriptive sentences that accurately describe the image's content and salient features.

**Technologies Used**

* **TensorFlow 2.0:** Deep learning and image processing
* **OpenCV:** Computer vision tasks
* **SpaCy:** Natural language processing
* **Flask:** Web API development

**Getting Started**

To use the Image Description API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/singhsourav0/Image_Description.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the API: `python app.py`
4. Send an HTTP POST request to the endpoint `http://localhost:5000/predict` with the image file as multipart/form-data.

**Response Format**

The API will return a JSON response with the following fields:

* `description`: A natural language description of the image.
* `scene`: A classification of the scene type (e.g., indoor, outdoor, landscape).
* `objects`: A list of objects detected in the image and their bounding boxes.

**Contribution Guidelines**

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these guidelines:

* Fork the repository and create a new branch.
* Make changes and add tests.
